However, Seven Pernicious Kingdoms also has a  Path Manipulation  phrase that is for external control of pathnames (CWE-73), which is a factor in symbolic link following and path traversal, neither of which is explicitly mentioned in 7PK. Fortify uses the phrase  Often Misused: Path Manipulation  for a broader range of problems, generally for issues related to buffer management. Given the multiple conflicting uses of this term, there is a chance that CWE users may have incorrectly mapped to this entry.The second reason for deprecation is an implied combination ofmultiple weaknesses within buffer-handling functions. Thefocus of this entry was generally on the path-conversionfunctions and their association with bufferoverflows. However, some of Fortify's Vulncat entries have theterm  path manipulation  but describe a non-overflow weaknessin which the buffer is not guaranteed to contain the entirepathname, i.e., there is information truncation (see CWE-222for a similar concept).
